# Exercise 1

## Problem Statement

Write a program that will take command line arguments to parse a given string to display counts of

- vowels
- digits
- symbols
- words

There should be flags to optionally display one or more of the above flags.

## Extension

Implement the above functionality but instead of parsing a string from the command line, read the information from a file.

Also find the number of lines of text in the file.

## References

The website [golang.org](https://golang.org/pkg/) has excellent documentation on different packages with a link to the Go Playground for each example.

The `strings` and `flag` packages would be good starting point for solving this exercise.

## Note

This exercise requires you to read and understand the official documentation. Reach out to the speakers/volunteers if you are stuck anywhere. Feel free to discuss with others around the table about possible solutions and learn from each other.
